## Step-by-Step: From Local to Packagist

### Step 1 — Create the GitHub Repository

1. Go to github.com and create a new repository named `laravel-social-auth`
2. Set it to public
3. Do not initialise with a README (you already have one)

Then push the generated package folder:

```bash
cd laravel-social-auth
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial release: v1.0.0"
git remote add origin https://github.com/learnwithfair/laravel-social-auth.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

### Step 2 — Tag a Release

Packagist resolves versions from Git tags. Always use semantic versioning.

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

### Step 3 — Create a Packagist Account

1. Go to packagist.org and register with your GitHub account
2. Verify your email address

---

### Step 4 — Submit the Package

1. On Packagist, click **Submit**
2. Paste your GitHub repository URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/learnwithfair/laravel-social-auth
   ```
3. Click **Check** — Packagist will read your `composer.json`
4. Click **Submit**

Your package will be live at:
```
https://packagist.org/packages/learnwithfair/laravel-social-auth
```

---

### Step 5 — Set Up the GitHub Webhook (Auto-Update)

Without a webhook, Packagist only sees new tags when you manually trigger a sync. The webhook makes it automatic.

1. In Packagist, go to your package page and click **GitHub Hook**
2. Copy the webhook URL and secret shown
3. In GitHub, go to your repo: Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook
4. Paste the URL, set Content-Type to `application/json`, paste the secret
5. Set the trigger to **Just the push event**
6. Save

From this point forward, every `git push` and every new tag will automatically update Packagist.

---

### Step 6 — Verify Installation Works End-to-End

Test on a fresh Laravel project:

```bash
laravel new test-app
cd test-app
composer require learnwithfair/laravel-social-auth
php artisan social-auth:install
php artisan migrate
```

Expected output from `social-auth:install`:

```
  Laravel Social Auth — Installation
  -----------------------------------

  Publishing configuration file...
  [ok] config/social-auth.php
  Publishing controller...
  [ok] app/Http/Controllers/Api/Auth/SocialAuthController.php
  Publishing migration...
  [ok] database/migrations/*_add_social_auth_columns_to_users_table.php
  [ok] .env — Google and Apple keys appended

  Installation complete. Complete the following steps:

  1. Set your credentials in .env ...
  2. Run the migration ...
  3. Ensure Laravel Sanctum is installed ...
  4. Register the SocialiteProviders event listener ...
  5. Add the route or use the package route at POST /api/social-login.
```

---

### Step 7 — Release Future Versions

For every subsequent change:

```bash
# Make your changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: handle missing avatar gracefully"
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin main --tags
```

Packagist will detect the new tag via the webhook and update automatically.

---

## How a Consumer Uses the Package

Once published, any Laravel developer installs it with a single command:

```bash
composer require learnwithfair/laravel-social-auth
php artisan social-auth:install
```

That is the entire setup. The install command handles config, controller, migration, and `.env` keys in one pass. They only need to fill in their actual client IDs.

---

## Optional Improvements for Later Versions

These are worth adding once v1.0.0 is stable:

- **GitHub Actions CI** — run `phpunit` on every push across PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and Laravel 10/11
- **Pest support** — migrate tests to Pest for more readable output
- **Avatar storage via Laravel Storage disk** — replace the `public_path` approach with a configurable disk so users can use S3 or any other driver
- **Token revocation on re-login** — optionally revoke old mobile tokens before issuing a new one
- **Apple secret generation command** — Apple login requires a JWT client secret generated from a `.p8` key file; a helper command would simplify that significantly
